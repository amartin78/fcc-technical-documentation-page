                <p>Introduction</p>
            </header>
            <p>This section explains the basic concept of functional programming; if you’re just interested in learning
                about Python l
                anguage features, skip to the next section on Iterators.</p>
            <p>Programming languages support decomposing problems in several different ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most programming languages are procedural: programs are lists of instructions that tell the computer
                    what to do
                    with the program’s input. C, Pascal, and even Unix shells are procedural languages.</li>
                <li>In declarative languages, you write a specification that describes the problem to be solved, and the
                    language
                    implementation figures out how to perform the computation efficiently. SQL is the declarative
                    language you’re
                    most likely to be familiar with; a SQL query describes the data set you want to retrieve, and the
                    SQL engine
                    decides whether to scan tables or use indexes, which subclauses should be performed first, etc.</li>
                <li>Object-oriented programs manipulate collections of objects. Objects have internal state and support
                    methods
                    that query or modify this internal state in some way. Smalltalk and Java are object-oriented
                    languages. C++ and
                    Python are languages that support object-oriented programming, but don’t force the use of
                    object-oriented
                    features.</li>
                <li>Functional programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take
                    inputs and
                    produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given
                    input.
                    Well-known functional languages include the ML family (Standard ML, OCaml, and other variants) and
                    Haskell.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The designers of some computer languages choose to emphasize one particular approach to programming. This
                often makes it difficult to
                write programs that use a different approach. Other languages are multi-paradigm languages that support
                several different approaches.
                Lisp, C++, and Python are multi-paradigm; you can write programs or libraries that are largely
                procedural, object-oriented, or
                functional in all of these languages. In a large program, different sections might be written using
                different approaches; the GUI
                might be object-oriented while the processing logic is procedural or functional, for example.</p>
            <p>In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions. Each function operates on its input and
                produces some
                output. Functional style discourages functions with side effects that modify internal state or make
                other changes that
                aren’t visible in the function’s return value. Functions that have no side effects at all are called
                purely functional.
                Avoiding side effects means not using data structures that get updated as a program runs; every
                function’s output must
                only depend on its input.</p>
            <p>Some languages are very strict about purity and don’t even have assignment statements such as a=3 or c =
                a + b, but it’s difficult to avoid all side effects. Printing to the screen or writing to a disk file
                are side effects, for example. For example, in Python a call to the print() or time.sleep() function
                both return no useful value; they’re only called for their side effects of sending some text to the
                screen or pausing execution for a second.</p>
            <p>Python programs written in functional style usually won’t go to the extreme of avoiding all I/O or all
                assignments; instead, they’ll provide a functional-appearing interface but will use non-functional
                features internally. For example, the implementation of a function will still use assignments to local
                variables, but won’t modify global variables or have other side effects.</p>
            <p>Functional programming can be considered the opposite of object-oriented programming. Objects are little
                capsules containing some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let you modify this
                state, and programs consist of making the right set of state changes. Functional programming wants to
                avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions. In Python you
                might combine the two approaches by writing functions that take and return instances representing
                objects in your application (e-mail messages, transactions, etc.).</p>
            <p>Functional design may seem like an odd constraint to work under. Why should you avoid objects and side
                effects? There are theoretical and practical advantages to the functional style:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Formal provability</li>
                <li>Modularity</li>
                <li>Composability</li>
                <li>Ease of debugging and testing</li>
            </ul>
